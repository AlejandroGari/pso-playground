# Streamlit PSO Optimization Visualizer

An interactive Streamlit application that demonstrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) on various benchmark functions. Explore and visualize how PSO converges on different objective functions!

There is a demo üòÅ [PSO playground](https://pso-playground.streamlit.app/)
## Overview

This repository contains a Streamlit app that showcases the power of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) by applying it to several test functions, including:

- **Modified Potential**
- **Ackley**
- **Griewangk**
- **Rastrigin**
- **Salomon**
- **Odd Square**
- **Schwefel**
- **Rana**

Users can select an objective function, adjust PSO parameters (such as the number of particles, inertia, personal best weight, and global best weight), and observe both the function landscape and the PSO convergence in real time.

## Features

- **Interactive UI:** User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Displays the objective function and the evolution of PSO convergence.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Easily modify PSO parameters to see how they affect optimization.
- **Multiple Benchmark Functions:** Explore a diverse set of functions to test the robustness of PSO.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
